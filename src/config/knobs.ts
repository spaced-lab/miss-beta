// WHAT: Every [knob] of the simulator with its GAME_PLAN default, in one object.
// WHY:  GAME_PLAN 0: balance is data work. Section 17 says fix constants, not targets; this is where the
//       constants live. STATUS.md records every value changed from the plan's default and why.
// HOW:  Grouped by the plan section that defines them. Values are SI unless the name says otherwise.
//       Grows milestone by milestone; do not pre-fill knobs for features that do not exist yet.
// LORE: G7 (under the hood)
