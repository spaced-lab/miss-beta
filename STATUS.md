# STATUS.md

One line per milestone, the knobs changed from GAME_PLAN defaults and why, decisions where the plan was silent,
and any formula tagged `[unverified]`. Detailed checklists live in `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md`.

## Milestones

| Milestone | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-M0 scaffold | done | Vite 8 / TS 5.9 / vitest 5, render foundation, RNG, font, title screen |
| PERIMETER minigame (side mode) | done, tuning | playable at `#minigame`; knobs in `src/minigame/config.ts` |
| M0 Skeleton and orbits | in progress | physics core next: constants, kepler, elements + pymiss mirror |
| M1 .. M12 | todo | see docs/BUILD_PLAN.md |

## Knobs changed from GAME_PLAN defaults

None in the sim yet (no sim knobs exist before M0 lands). Minigame knobs are not in GAME_PLAN; their defaults
are the values in `src/minigame/config.ts` and the 2026-10-17 tuning (FIELD_R 5.6, VIEW_R 6.2 so the planet
reads larger on wide screens).

## Decisions where the plan was silent

- Vitest 5 has no `bench` export; benchmarks are timing tests under `bench/` selected with `MISS_BENCH=1`.
- CSP is injected at build time only (dev tooling needs an open page). The policy string is `CSP` in `vite.config.ts`.
- A dev-only `/__dev/shot` endpoint saves the canvas as PNG for automated visual checks (never in the build).
- Cheat codes are committed and documented in source (user decision 2026-10-17).
- The minigame's collision default is `auto` (naive under 20k pairs, grid above), from `bench/collision.bench.ts`
  on Apple Silicon / node 26: 100x20 naive 4.5 us vs grid 10.5 us; 800x120 naive 221 us vs grid 121 us.
- Stroke font: hand-built arcade face now; Hershey evaluated in M8 behind the same interface.

## Unverified

None yet. (Benz-Asphaug Q* coefficients and the detection network parameters will be tagged here in M3/M5
until checked against the sources in GAME_PLAN Appendix B.)
